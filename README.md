## Description

This repository assumes that you have PiHole up and running. Consider using the instructional written by [CrossTalk Solutions](https://www.crosstalksolutions.com/the-worlds-greatest-pi-hole-and-unbound-tutorial-2023/) for the initial setup. The [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/cE21YjuaB6o) worked well for me.

## What is PiHole?

Network-wide ad blocking via your own Linux hardware

The Pi-holeÂ® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

- **Easy-to-install**: our versatile installer walks you through the process and takes less than ten minutes
- **Resolute**: content is blocked in non-browser locations, such as ad-laden mobile apps and smart TVs
- **Responsive**: seamlessly speeds up the feel of everyday browsing by caching DNS queries
- **Lightweight**: runs smoothly with [minimal hardware and software requirements](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequisites/)
- **Robust**: a command-line interface that is quality assured for interoperability
- **Insightful**: a beautiful responsive Web Interface dashboard to view and control your Pi-hole
- **Versatile**: can optionally function as a DHCP server, ensuring all your devices are protected automatically
- **Scalable**: capable of handling hundreds of millions of queries when installed on server-grade hardware
- **Modern**: blocks ads over both IPv4 and IPv6
- **Free**: open-source software which helps ensure you are the sole person in control of your privacy

## Ad Lists

As recommended in the [CrossTalk Solutions](https://www.crosstalksolutions.com/the-worlds-greatest-pi-hole-and-unbound-tutorial-2023/) tutorial, I referenced [The Firebog](https://firebog.net/) for a majority of the lists that I implemented.

Here is a complete list of the ad lists that I've implemented:

I did have to whitelist `slackb.com` to use slack on my network.

## Automation

Here are the steps that I took to make my PiHole self-sufficient.

### Send an Email using Python

1. Read through the entire [Send an Email using Python](./docs/smtp.md) document and then go back and follow the instructions up until "The Email-Sending Script".
1. Copy these 3 files to the root of your Raspberry Pi or server:
   - [pihole\_configs.example.json](./pihole_configs.example.json)
   - [pihole\_email\_before\_restart.py](./pihole_email_before_restart.py)
   - [pihole\_email\_after\_restart.py](./pihole_email_after_restart.py)
1. Set the configs file by running `mv pihole_configs.example.json pihole_configs.json` in your terminal and then `sudo nano pihole_configs.json`.
1. Use your arrow keys to navigate to the values, remove the `REPLACE_WITH_THE_...` text and then fill in the appropriate values.
1. You created the `from_addr` and `from_pass` when you followed the [Send an Email using Python](./docs/smtp.md) document.
1. For the `to_addr`, I get the email message as a text to my phone. Here are some examples of how to do with with major cellular providers. Remember to replace "1234567890" with your cell phone number:
   - **AT&T**: 1234567890@txt.att.net
   - **Verizon**: 1234567890@vtext.com
   - **T-Mobile**: 1234567890@tmomail.net
1. Once you have all 3 values filled in, you can press <kbd>[^X]</kbd>, <kbd>[y]</kbd> and <kbd>[return]</kbd> to save your changes and exit the file.
1. Test that the email files work by running `python pihole_email_before_restart.py` and `python pihole_email_after_restart.py` in your terminal and then either checking your inbox or watching your phone for a text (depending on the value you entered for the `to_addr`).

### Update Script Using Bash

1. Copy the [pihole_update.sh](./pihole_update.sh) file to the root of your Raspberry Pi or server. No editing necessary.

### Automatically Update and Send Emails Using Cron

1. Run `sudo crontab -e` in your terminal
1. Add the following code to the end of the file:<br><pre>55 1 * * 6 python pihole\_email\_before\_restart.py
0 2 * * 6 ./pihole_update.sh >> pihole.log 2>&1
30 2 * * 6 python pihole\_email\_after\_restart.py</pre>
   - The 1st line is saying to run the `pihole_email_before_restart.py` file every Saturday morning at 1:55AM.
   - The 2nd line is saying to run the `pihole_update.sh` file every Saturday morning at 2:00AM and capture the output in the `pihole.log` file (it will automatically get created if it's not already there).
   - The 3rd line is saying to run the `pihole_email_after_restart.py` file every Saturday morning at 2:30AM.
   - Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) if you'd like to adjust when these scripts run.
1. Now press <kbd>[^X]</kbd>, <kbd>[y]</kbd> and <kbd>[return]</kbd> to save your changes and exit the file.
1. Validate that the file saved by running `sudo crontab -l` in your terminal. You should see the values that you entered

## To Do / Consideration

- Set the email pass as an environment variable instead of in the config file - [Python Environment Variables](https://networkdirection.net/python/resources/env-variable/)
